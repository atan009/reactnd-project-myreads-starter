# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads Project from the Udacity Reactjs Nanodegree program.
The starter template can be acquired from this [repo](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

## Install

* Download the zip and extract the files or clone this repo directly
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Running

The main page has 3 book shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read
The books can be moved from shelve to shelve by clicking the down arrow and making a selection
Books can be removed by clicking the none option
To search for books, click the plus on the lower right
Type your search query at the top and hit enter to send the search query
20 books will be populated which can be added to the shelves in the previous manner

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
